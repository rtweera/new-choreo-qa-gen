{"question": "What kind of information can I see when I explore a service in detail?", "answer": "When you click on a service card to open its detailed view, you'll see the service name, summary, version, labels, and service icon in the header. The service content is further organized into four tabs:\n- **Overview**: Displays the service overview provided by the service developer.\n- **API definition**: Includes the API definition for the service, extracted from the `component.yaml` file.\n- **How to use**: Provides instructions on how to use the selected service, including how to create a connection.\n- **Related documents**: Includes any additional content the user has provided as documents through the Manage -> Marketplace section of the component.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\choreo-marketplace.md/Explore a service", "topic": "Explore a service"}
{"question": "How do services get added to the Choreo Marketplace?", "answer": "Choreo services are automatically added to the Marketplace upon their initial deployment to any environment. During this deployment, Choreo effortlessly collects essential details such as the component name, endpoint name, description, and service definitions, using them to generate the corresponding service entries. The service name in the Marketplace follows the convention of `component name - endpoint name`.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\choreo-marketplace.md/Add a service to the Choreo Marketplace - Add a Choreo service", "topic": "Add a service to the Choreo Marketplace - Add a Choreo service"}
{"question": "How does service versioning work in the Choreo Marketplace?", "answer": "In the Choreo Marketplace, service versions are displayed in their major version format (e.g., `v1`, `v2`). Each service entry represents the *latest* version of the service within its major version, following semantic versioning principles. For example, if you have `v1.0`, `v1.1`, and `v1.2`, the Marketplace will display `v1` representing `v1.2`. When a new minor version of an already deployed service is released, the corresponding service in the Marketplace automatically updates to reflect this latest version within the same major version.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\choreo-marketplace.md/Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace", "topic": "Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace"}
{"question": "If I connect to a service from the Marketplace, how does it handle new minor versions?", "answer": "When you use a service from the Choreo Marketplace as a dependency, the dependent service's traffic is automatically routed to the latest version of the corresponding service within the same major version. This semantic-version-based intelligent routing ensures that your dependencies remain up-to-date without requiring manual updates within a major version. For instance, if you connect to `Bar` v1, and `Bar` v1.3 is subsequently released, traffic from your component will automatically route to `Bar` v1.3.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\choreo-marketplace.md/Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace - Semantic-version-based intelligent routing", "topic": "Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace - Semantic-version-based intelligent routing"}
{"question": "Can I edit or update service information in the Choreo Marketplace?", "answer": "Yes, you can edit services in the Choreo Marketplace. During redeployment to any environment, Choreo automatically updates service definitions, network visibility settings, and descriptions in the Marketplace.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\choreo-marketplace.md/Edit services in the Choreo Marketplace", "topic": "Edit services in the Choreo Marketplace"}
{"question": "What is Choreo's approach to CI/CD?", "answer": "Choreo provides a streamlined continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) experience designed to efficiently deploy applications and services across multiple environments. It emphasizes an isolated environment setup for each project, where all components within that project share the same environments.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/CI/CD", "topic": "CI/CD"}
{"question": "How do environments work in Choreo, and can I customize them?", "answer": "In Choreo, an environment is an isolated deployment area with restricted network and resource access, meaning services deployed in one environment cannot communicate with those in another. The Choreo cloud data plane offers two default environments: development and production. However, if you are in a private data plane organization, you have the flexibility to customize and create multiple environments based on your specific requirements.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/CI/CD", "topic": "CI/CD"}
{"question": "What does the 'build once, deploy many' strategy mean in Choreo?", "answer": "The 'build once, deploy many' strategy means that an application is built only once (either per commit if automatic build on commit is enabled, or based on a selected commit during a manual build). This single built artifact is then promoted to subsequent environments. This approach is beneficial because it allows you to thoroughly test changes in lower, non-production environments like development before promoting the verified build to production.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/CI/CD", "topic": "CI/CD"}
{"question": "How does Choreo handle configurations and secrets for different environments, and are they secure?", "answer": "Choreo injects configurations and secrets, which you maintain at the environment level, directly into components at runtime. This ensures a strict separation of environment-specific configurations from your source code, meaning the code and built container remain unchanged even if configurations vary across environments. These can include credentials for databases, caches, external cloud services like Amazon S3, or external APIs. All configurations and secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit and stored in a secure vault. In a private data plane organization, you also have the option to store them in your own infrastructure.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/CI/CD / Configurations", "topic": "CI/CD / Configurations"}
{"question": "What are the typical steps involved in a Choreo build pipeline?", "answer": "Choreo auto-generates build pipelines that generally include building a container image from the provided source code or a Dockerfile for a specific commit, running security and vulnerability scans (if applicable based on component type), pushing the container image to a container registry (Choreo-managed for cloud data plane, user-owned for private data plane), and updating service endpoints and API specifications from the provided repository (if applicable). Some buildpacks also support integrating unit tests.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Build", "topic": "Build"}
{"question": "Can I integrate unit tests into the build process?", "answer": "Yes, some buildpacks in Choreo support integrating unit tests directly into the build pipeline. For more detailed information on how to do this, you can refer to the documentation on 'Integrate Unit Tests into the Build Pipeline'.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Build", "topic": "Build"}
{"question": "What are 'repeatable builds' in Choreo?", "answer": "Repeatable builds in Choreo mean that if you initiate multiple builds from the exact same Git commit, they will consistently generate Docker images with identical behavior. It's important to note that Choreo preserves only the most recent version of the Docker image created from a particular code version.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Build / Repeatable builds", "topic": "Build / Repeatable builds"}
{"question": "How do I trigger a build in Choreo, and can it be automated?", "answer": "You can manually trigger a build by navigating to the **Build** page and clicking **Build Latest**, with the option to select a particular commit if needed. To automate builds, you can enable **Auto Build on Commit**, which will automatically trigger a build with each new commit. Additionally, Admin and Choreo DevOps users have the capability to trigger builds using specific tags from the connected Git repository, though this action is typically reserved for critical, time-sensitive scenarios as it bypasses the standard branch-based deployment process.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Build / Trigger a build", "topic": "Build / Trigger a build"}
{"question": "Where can I view the logs for my builds?", "answer": "You can view build logs for specific builds directly on the **Build** page. To access detailed information for a particular build, simply click on **View Details** corresponding to that build.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Build / Build logs", "topic": "Build / Build logs"}
{"question": "How do I deploy an image in Choreo, and can I automate deployments?", "answer": "Once an image is built in Choreo, you can deploy it via the **Deploy** page. You have two main approaches: you can **Manually deploy** by going to the **Set Up** card and clicking **Deploy**, or you can **Automatically deploy on build** by enabling this option on the **Set Up** card. Enabling automatic deployment will initiate deployment automatically upon the completion of an automatic build. Note that to enable **Auto Deploy on Build**, you must first enable **Auto Build on Commit**.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Deployment", "topic": "Deployment"}
{"question": "Are there any special considerations for deploying Ballerina components?", "answer": "Yes, for Ballerina components, you must trigger the very first build manually to ensure that Choreo applies the required configurations to the development environment; automatic builds can be enabled subsequently. Choreo also automatically checks the configurable values defined in your Ballerina source code against those applied in an environment during deployment and promotion. If you've changed the configurables, auto-build pipelines might fail as a precaution to prevent component crashes at runtime due to missing configurations. This configurable verifying capability is only available for Ballerina components. For Dockerfile-based components, you need to manually manage and update configurations and secrets in environments ahead of time and ensure backward compatibility.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Deployment", "topic": "Deployment"}
{"question": "What happens if I change configurations after a component is deployed?", "answer": "Once Choreo deploys a component with configurations, those configurations become immutable. Any subsequent change to these configurations will necessitate and result in a new deployment.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Deployment / Immutable deployments", "topic": "Deployment / Immutable deployments"}
{"question": "How do I promote a component from one environment to another, like from development to production?", "answer": "Choreo adopts a 'build once, deploy many' strategy, meaning a container is built once per GitHub commit and then promoted to subsequent higher environments. You can manually promote a component across environments by going to its **Deploy** page.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Deployment / Promote a component to a higher environment", "topic": "Deployment / Promote a component to a higher environment"}
{"question": "What's the difference between environment-independent and environment-specific configurations, and how do I manage them?", "answer": "Choreo allows for both: **Environment-independent configurations** apply to all environments. To change these, go to the component's **Deploy** page, make the necessary changes via the **Set Up** card, and then trigger a new deployment to the initial environment before promoting the component to higher environments. **Environment-specific configurations** apply only to a particular environment. To change these, go to the component's **Deploy** page, make the necessary changes via the specific environment card, and then trigger a new deployment for that particular environment.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Configurations", "topic": "Configurations"}
{"question": "How can I monitor the execution of my scheduled or manual tasks?", "answer": "For scheduled and manual task components, you can track and monitor their executions by navigating to the **Execute** page from the left navigation menu. This page provides current and historic execution details, including a quick snapshot of recent activity (total count within the last 30 days), unique execution IDs, trigger times, and relevant revision information. You can also click on a specific execution to access its associated logs for deeper analysis and troubleshooting.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Task execution", "topic": "Task execution"}
{"question": "Does Choreo ensure my application stays online during deployments or promotions?", "answer": "Yes, Choreo performs rolling updates to ensure zero downtime between deployments and promotions. A new build undergoes a health check before traffic is switched to it from the current build. By configuring the necessary health checks for your component, you can prevent the deployment and promotion of unhealthy versions.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\ci-cd.md/Zero-downtime deployments", "topic": "Zero-downtime deployments"}
{"question": "What exactly is a 'component' in Choreo?", "answer": "In Choreo, a component represents a single unit of work within a cloud-native application. It's typically a microservice, an API, or a job/task, and it serves as Choreo's fundamental unit of deployment.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\component.md/Component", "topic": "Component"}
{"question": "How does Choreo handle the deployment of individual parts of my application?", "answer": "Choreo uses a component as its unit of deployment. This means that each component maps directly to a single pod in the Kubernetes cluster at deployment time, allowing you to deploy, manage, and scale each component independently.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\component.md/Component", "topic": "Component"}
{"question": "Where does Choreo expect to find the code or build instructions for a component?", "answer": "Each component in Choreo is attached to a specific directory path within a Git repository. This directory must contain either the program's source code or a Dockerfile with the necessary build instructions.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\component.md/Component", "topic": "Component"}
{"question": "What are some examples of the different types of components Choreo supports?", "answer": "Choreo supports various component types designed for different use cases, including services, API proxies, integrations, and web applications.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\component.md/Component", "topic": "Component"}
{"question": "Do different component types in Choreo offer unique features?", "answer": "Yes, each component type in Choreo comes with unique features tailored to its characteristics. For example, a scheduled integration component can accept a cron expression to schedule an integration job or task.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\component.md/Component", "topic": "Component"}
{"question": "Can I manage and scale different parts of my application independently within Choreo?", "answer": "Absolutely. Since a component is Choreo's unit of deployment and maps to a single Kubernetes pod, you have the flexibility to deploy, manage, and scale each component independently.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\component.md/Component", "topic": "Component"}
{"question": "What are 'Connections' in Choreo and why would I use them?", "answer": "In Choreo, 'Connections' are a feature that allows you to integrate services you intend to deploy on Choreo with other services already on Choreo or with external resources. Their main purpose is to help you create integrated solutions by enabling communication between different services and resources.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Connections", "topic": "Connections"}
{"question": "How do I use a Connection in my service once it's created in Choreo?", "answer": "Once you create a connection, Choreo provides you with a Connection ID and a set of connection parameters. You then configure your service to establish a connection using this Connection ID and map the connection parameters to environment variable names within your Choreo component. Your service implementation can then read these environment variables to retrieve the values and create a programmatic connection to the desired service.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Connections", "topic": "Connections"}
{"question": "What are the benefits of using Choreo's Connections for integrating services?", "answer": "Using Connections ensures that the connection parameter values and the service connection creation remain loosely coupled. This approach provides developers with flexibility and ease of maintenance, as Choreo dynamically injects the necessary values into environment variables at runtime.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Connections", "topic": "Connections"}
{"question": "What's the difference between Project Connections and Component Connections in Choreo?", "answer": "The primary difference lies in their visibility and scope. Project Connections are created at the project level and can be used by *any component* within that particular project. In contrast, Component Connections are defined at the individual component level and can only be used by *that specific component*.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Project Connections, Component Connections", "topic": "Project Connections, Component Connections"}
{"question": "When should I use a Project Connection instead of a Component Connection? Can you give an example?", "answer": "You should use a Project Connection when you want to share a connection to a service or resource across multiple components within the same project. For example, if you want all components in your project to reuse a third-party service like Twilio, you would create a Project Connection for it. Components can then refer to this connection using its Connection ID.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Project Connections", "topic": "Project Connections"}
{"question": "When is it more appropriate to use a Component Connection?", "answer": "It's more appropriate to use a Component Connection when the connection is specific to a single component and doesn't need to be shared across the entire project. For instance, if only a particular component needs to connect to a legacy service, you would create a Component Connection for that specific integration.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Component Connections", "topic": "Component Connections"}
{"question": "How do Project Connections handle OAuth security when shared across multiple components?", "answer": "For Project Connections created to consume Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, they will share the same OAuth application across the project. This means any component reusing such a connection will use the same client ID and client secret.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Project Connections", "topic": "Project Connections"}
{"question": "If my component consumes multiple Choreo services, can Component Connections help with OAuth?", "answer": "Yes, if your component consumes more than one Choreo service, the Component Connections created to consume those services under the OAuth security scheme can share the same OAuth application. This is achieved by sharing the same client ID and secret between all such connections within that specific component.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\connections.md/Component Connections", "topic": "Component Connections"}
{"question": "What are the core components of Choreo's architecture?", "answer": "Choreo's architecture is built around two main components: the control plane and the data plane.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Data Planes", "topic": "Data Planes"}
{"question": "What is the primary role of the Choreo control plane?", "answer": "The control plane is responsible for essential administrative tasks like managing organizations, users, and projects.

{"question": "Who are the typical users or personas that interact with the Choreo control plane?", "answer": "The Choreo control plane caters to a diverse range of user personas, including CIOs, architects, developers, DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and platform engineers.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Data Planes", "topic": "Data Planes"}
{"question": "What exactly is a Choreo data plane, and what types of applications can be deployed there?", "answer": "The data plane is the environment where your user applications are deployed, based on the configurations you set in the control plane. You can deploy various types of applications, such as services, web applications, APIs, integrations, and scheduled tasks. It supports a polyglot approach, meaning applications can be written in different programming languages.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Data Planes", "topic": "Data Planes"}
{"question": "How does Choreo ensure the security and containment of my application's runtime data and traffic?", "answer": "Choreo ensures strict containment by restricting all traffic related to the runtime of user applications to within the Choreo data plane itself. This design helps keep your user data securely within its boundaries.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Data Planes", "topic": "Data Planes"}
{"question": "What are the two different types of data planes offered by Choreo, and how do they differ?", "answer": "Choreo offers two distinct data plane types: cloud data planes and private data planes (PDPs). A cloud data plane uses a multi-tenanted infrastructure, providing a shared yet secure environment for deploying user applications. In contrast, a private data plane offers dedicated infrastructure specifically for a single organization, ensuring an enhanced layer of privacy and control.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Data Planes", "topic": "Data Planes"}

This is managed through the Flux controller, which is connected to the Choreo Update Management System.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Private data planes - System components", "topic": "Private data planes - System components"}
{"question": "Does the private data plane need to communicate with the Choreo control plane, and what are the network requirements for this communication?", "answer": "Yes, the private data plane requires communication with the Choreo control plane for various management activities. All these communications are outbound from the private data plane, meaning you don't need to open any specific inbound IP:Port. However, if your organization's network restricts all outbound traffic, you will need to permit outbound traffic to the public IP range of the Choreo control plane.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Private data planes - Connectivity with the control plane", "topic": "Private data planes - Connectivity with the control plane"}
{"question": "How does Choreo ensure data privacy and compliance for logs and observability data within a private data plane?", "answer": "Choreo's private data plane observability architecture is designed with a strong commitment to data privacy and compliance. Logs and observability data are retained directly within the data plane itself. The Choreo Console in the user's browser interacts directly with APIs in the data plane, minimizing data transfer points and ensuring data locality, which helps align with regulatory standards like GDPR and CCPA.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Private data planes - Observability architecture", "topic": "Private data planes - Observability architecture"}
{"question": "What are the key security features implemented in the Choreo private data plane?", "answer": "The Choreo private data plane offers extensive, production-grade security.

{"question": "What are the different management models available for Choreo private data planes?", "answer": "Choreo supports three management models for private data planes, fostering collaboration between WSO2 and customers: WSO2 fully managed (where both infrastructure and PDP are in a WSO2 subscription), WSO2 fully managed (where infrastructure and PDP are in the customer's subscription), and Customer self-managed (where WSO2 provides the installation script and updates, but the customer manages the infrastructure).", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\data-planes.md/Private data planes - Management models", "topic": "Private data planes - Management models"}
{"question": "What exactly are Deployment Tracks in Choreo and what's their main purpose?", "answer": "Deployment Tracks in Choreo are structured pathways designed for simplified software component deployment. They function like advanced CI/CD pipelines, ensuring your components are delivered seamlessly, whether they originate from source code or prebuilt images. Their primary purpose is to establish an organized and structured approach that significantly reduces errors and challenges typically associated with deployment workflows.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\deployment-tracks.md/Deployment Tracks", "topic": "Deployment Tracks"}
{"question": "Why should I use Deployment Tracks? What are the key benefits they offer?", "answer": "Deployment Tracks offer practical solutions to enhance the API consumer experience by addressing two critical challenges: streamlined deployment and efficient API versioning. They serve as well-designed routes for your software components, improving the organization and reliability of the deployment process. For managed APIs, they provide a straightforward method for creating new API versions that seamlessly interact with previous iterations, simplifying version management for both creators and consumers.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\deployment-tracks.md/The significance of Deployment Tracks", "topic": "The significance of Deployment Tracks"}
{"question": "How do Deployment Tracks integrate with a full CI/CD pipeline, especially if I'm using GitHub?", "answer": "When using a full CI/CD approach, a deployment track is linked to a specific branch within a GitHub repository. This connection allows you to easily visualize deployments to various environments on Choreo's Deploy page. Furthermore, the deployment track can initiate automatic deployments for the linked branch; for instance, merging a pull request (PR) will trigger a deployment to the development environment.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\deployment-tracks.md/CI/CD with Deployment Tracks", "topic": "CI/CD with Deployment Tracks"}
{"question": "Can I use Deployment Tracks if I already have my own Continuous Integration (CI) system and only want Choreo for Continuous Deployment (CD)?", "answer": "Yes, you can use the CD-Only strategy with Deployment Tracks. If you prefer to use your own CI systems, you can seamlessly link deployment tracks to a container registry repository. This configuration enables you to effortlessly deploy images directly sourced from that linked container registry repository, leveraging Choreo purely as a CD pipeline.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\deployment-tracks.md/CD-Only strategy with Deployment Tracks", "topic": "CD-Only strategy with Deployment Tracks"}
{"question": "How do Deployment Tracks handle API versioning for service components in Choreo?", "answer": "For service components, Deployment Tracks facilitate effective API versioning by following a mechanism based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer), specifically using the major and minor versions with a 'v' prefix (e.g., `v1.2`). API developers only need to specify the major and minor versions being delivered from a particular deployment track, which is treated as the API version attribute. This approach helps minimize disruption for API consumers when updates are continuously deployed.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\deployment-tracks.md/Efficient API versioning", "topic": "Efficient API versioning"}
{"question": "When should I increment the major versus the minor version of my API when using Deployment Tracks in Choreo?", "answer": "In Choreo's API versioning with Deployment Tracks, you should increment the major version when you introduce incompatible API changes. You should increment the minor version when you add new functionality in a backward-compatible manner. This aligns with the Semantic Versioning specification.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\deployment-tracks.md/Efficient API versioning", "topic": "Efficient API versioning"}
{"question": "If Choreo's API versioning focuses on major and minor versions, how do I manage patch updates or internal version tracking?", "answer": "While Choreo's API version attribute for deployment tracks focuses on major and minor versions (as these are typically what concern API consumers most), changes that don't introduce breaking or additive modifications are categorized as patch updates. These should ideally not disrupt API clients. For internal tracking purposes, such as managing patch versions or other granular releases, publishers can use external tools like Git tags, GitHub releases, or similar mechanisms.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\deployment-tracks.md/Efficient API versioning", "topic": "Efficient API versioning"}
{"question": "What exactly is an Endpoint in Choreo?", "answer": "In Choreo, an Endpoint is a network-exposed function that resides within a component. Specifically, service and integration components expose one or more endpoints.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\endpoint.md/Endpoint Definition", "topic": "Endpoint Definition"}
{"question": "Do I need to provide a service contract for an endpoint in Choreo, and what happens if I don't?", "answer": "Each endpoint in a component can have a service contract, such as OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL, associated with it. This contract is used to expose the endpoint to consumers. If a contract is not provided, Choreo uses `/* exposed on all HTTP verbs` as the default contract to expose the service or integration.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\endpoint.md/Service Contract", "topic": "Service Contract"}
{"question": "How does Choreo handle API management for endpoints? Can I manage each endpoint separately?", "answer": "Yes, Choreo considers each endpoint exposed in a component as a single API. This allows you to perform API management per endpoint for a given component.", "source": "docs\\choreo-concepts\\endpoint.md/API Management", "topic": "API Management"}
