This allows testing changes in lower, non-production environments like development before promoting the build to production.",docs\choreo-concepts\ci-cd.md/CI/CD Overview & Environments
"How does Choreo handle configurations and secrets, and what types of information do they include?","Choreo injects configurations and secrets that you maintain at the environment level into components at runtime. This ensures a strict separation of environment-specific configurations from source code. Although configurations can vary across environments, the code and the built container remain unchanged.

This automatically initiates deployment upon the completion of an automatic build.",docs\choreo-concepts\ci-cd.md/Deployment
"What is the prerequisite for enabling 'Auto Deploy on Build', and why is it necessary?","To enable **Auto Deploy on Build**, you must enable **Auto Build on Commit**. This is because automatic deployment is not necessary or useful in scenarios where automatic build is not enabled.",docs\choreo-concepts\ci-cd.md/Deployment
"Are there any special considerations for deploying Ballerina components, especially regarding configurable values?","Yes, you must trigger the first build in a Ballerina component manually to ensure that Choreo applies the required configurations to the development environment, after which automatic builds can be enabled. Choreo automatically checks the configurable defined in your source code against the configurable values applied in an environment. Choreo requests the configurable values on deployment and promotion. If you have changed the configurables in your Ballerina component, auto-build pipelines can fail as a precaution to avoid a component crash at runtime due to missing configurables. This configurable verifying capability is only available for Ballerina components.",docs\choreo-concepts\ci-cd.md/Deployment
What precautions should be taken for Dockerfile-based components regarding configurations and secrets?,"For Dockerfile-based components, you must ensure to manage and update the configurations and secrets in environments ahead of time.
