From there, the component can be promoted to higher environments.",docs\choreo-concepts\ci-cd.md/Configurations
"How do environment-specific configurations apply, and what is the process for changing them?","Environment-specific configurations apply to a particular environment. To change them, users need to go to the 'Deploy' page of the component, make the necessary configuration changes via the specific environment card, and then trigger a new deployment.",docs\choreo-concepts\ci-cd.md/Configurations

"How do components refer to Project Connections, and what is the implication for OAuth security schemes when using Project Connections to consume Choreo services?","Components can refer to Project Connections using the connection ID. When Project Connections are created to consume Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, they will share the same OAuth application across the project, meaning any component reusing such a connection will use the same client ID and client secret.",docs\choreo-concepts\connections.md/Project Connections
